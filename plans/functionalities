- track how many tabs are opened and visible with which names -> done!
- allow presets to read -> done!
- track time without any cursor movement and have a threshold -> done!
    - afk detection in 3 mins of no moving, scrolling or typing
        - how long have I been away for? - and only after clicking show
        - give option to still track this time as main app or other
    -> be able to set it up yourself?
    
-> work mode: have a set of apps that are "allowed" to be in main view.
    -> any distraction from these apps more than 5 mins will lead to a screenwide warning
        -> means these have to be specifically selected beforehand
            -> okay, so you make a list of the currently detected apps as tree and delete from the tree
                -> so let's try first to do just the list with the time bad, to test out the layout
        -> "You wasted 5 mins since last warning on "fun" apps.
- break mode: just track Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, reddit, discord -> done!

-> allow putting alarms
- save files -> done!
-> add some day counters and maybe goals
    -> or maybe make day end and save it in a file
-> stats per hours of the day.

-> several lists of options (files)
-> more filters
-> ability to select a particular window entry as belonging somewhere else.
-> categories that are made only of their contents (a checkbox in the settings whether Misc even exists)

-> fix someone looking in a Notepad - Untitled * Tab.
-> fix no Linux version
-> fix repeated names + Misc names
- fix the timing issue (use an actual timer?) -> done!
- fix not recognising scrolling -> done!



TikTok? really? you didn't learn any better?
Twitter? Better put your brain in the freezer. Seems more productive
