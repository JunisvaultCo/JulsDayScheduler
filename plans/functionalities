-> track how many tabs are opened and visible with which names -> done!
-> allow presets to read -> done!
-> track time without any cursor movement and have a threshold
-> allow putting alarms
-> save files -> done!
-> add some day counters and maybe goals
-> several lists of options (files)
-> fix someone looking in a Notepad - Untitled * Tab.

-> work mode: have a set of apps that are "allowed" to be in main view.
    -> any distraction from these apps more than 5 mins will lead to a screenwide warning
        -> "You wasted 5 mins since last warning on "fun" apps.
    -> afk detection in 3 mins of no moving, scrolling or typing
        -> how long have I been away for? - and only after clicking show
        -> give option to still track this time as main app or other

-> break mode: track Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, reddit, discord if possible (through window names?)
    -> any distraction of more than 5 mins with these apps will lead to a screenwide warning
    -> extra extra: have an option to set these sites and apps.

-> have somewhere where you can see which apps are opened

-> fix the timing issue (use an actual timer?) -> done!

TikTok? really? you didn't learn any better?
Twitter? Better put your brain in the freezer. Seems more productive
