- track how many tabs are opened and visible with which names -> done!
- allow presets to read -> done!
- track time without any cursor movement and have a threshold -> done!
    - afk detection in 3 mins of no moving, scrolling or typing
        - how long have I been away for? - and only after clicking show
        - give option to still track this time as main app or other
    -> be able to set it up yourself?
    
- work mode: have a set of apps that are "allowed" to be in main view. -> done!
    - any distraction from these apps more than 5 mins will lead to a screenwide warning
        - means these have to be specifically selected beforehand
            - okay, so you make a list of the currently detected apps as tree and delete from the tree
                - so let's try first to do just the list with the time bad, to test out the layout
        - "You wasted 5 mins since last warning on "fun" apps.
        -> what do we do with intersections of AFK and work mode warnings? 
                -> Just keep them both? No, the interactions are going to be really messy.
        -> change options of work mode without stopping it
- break mode: just track Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, reddit, discord -> done!

- have a place on the main widget to see how much time has been spent on the right thing. -> done!
-> save the total bad and good work mode data in a file?

-> start saving them in a different way as we were saying:
    -> save hour minute and second of start of an activity. As well as work mode.

-> afk mode instead continues counting whatever it sees and gives you several options:
    -> label it as nothing
    -> label it as a name (like until now)
    -> label it as combo of all that have been since you last didn't press? I guess

-> allow putting alarms
- save files -> done!
-> add some day counters
    -> maybe goals
    -> or maybe make day end and save it in a file
-> stats per hours of the day.
    -> have them drawn with a special widget as name, total time, + LINES okay?

-> several lists of options (files)
-> more filters
-> ability to select a particular window entry as belonging somewhere else.
    -> this sounds really really sucky.
-> categories that are made only of their contents (a checkbox in the settings whether Misc even exists)

-> fix someone looking in a Notepad - Untitled * Tab.
-> fix no Linux version
-> fix repeated names + Misc names in the option settings
- fix the timing issue (use an actual timer?) -> done!
- fix not recognising scrolling -> done!



TikTok? really? you didn't learn any better?
Twitter? Better put your brain in the freezer. Seems more productive
